## Hello~! What?!
Welcome to User Guides, the community driven guidebook for rAthena. This is a place where you can find guides on how to install, configure, and use rAthena. If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the [rAthena Forums](https://rathena.org/board/).

## Why Should I Use This?
This area of rAthena has been created by the community, for the community. If you have a guide you would like to share with the community, you can submit a pull request to the [rAthena User-Guides Repository](https://github.com/rathena/user-guides/) on GitHub. Due to the nature of how Github Wiki's work (and their access requirements for modifying them), we have decided to move our guides to a repository instead. This will allow us to have more control over the content and have a more streamlined process for submitting and reviewing guides. We hope you enjoy this new format, and we look forward to seeing your contributions!

## What About The Old Guides?
Guides that are currently located on the rA Wiki will slowly migrate over to here. If you are looking for a guide that is not yet on this site, you can find it on the [rAthena Wiki](https://rathena.org/wiki/).

There are a multitude of guides available on the forums, too, though many are extremely out-of-date and contain links to dead resources. Their authors may no longer be on the scene, which makes keeping them up-to-date a difficult task. This is why we encourage users to now make their guides available here, where they can be kept up-to-date and easily accessibleby everyone.

## How Do I Use This?
This guidebook is split into several sections for ease-of-use. Simply click around and follow links to where you need to go, or try searching for what you need using the search bar at the top of the page.

## How Do I Contribute?
If you have a guide you would like to share with the community, you can submit a pull request to the [rAthena User-Guides Repository](https://github.com/rathena/user-guides/) on GitHub. Please ensure that your guide sits in the correct folder, and that it is written in Markdown. If you are unfamiliar with Markdown, you can use [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app#) to write your guide in Markdown, or use the [GitHub Markdown Editor](https://jbt.github.io/markdown-editor/) to preview your guide as you write it.

## How Do I Get Help?
If you have any questions about these guides, or feel that any of them need clarifying, feel free to shoot a message into the `#user-guides` channel on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/kMeMXWEvSV) server.
